This project builds upon my previous project that was intended for managing a single restaurant. <br>In this version, the system has been extended to handle multiple restaurants, allowing users to browse, order, and pay from a variety of restaurants, similar to platforms like GrabFood or Baemin.


My previous project: **sourced from [BaoTran019](https://github.com/BaoTran019/foodfast-delivery-web)**

**Note: Differences from the previous project:**
- **Old project:** Built for a single restaurant, using **Spring Boot** for API and **SQL Server** as the database.
- **New project:** Supports multiple restaurants, built using **Firebase** (Firestore, Auth, Storage) for backend and database.

The new project allows:
- Dynamic management of multiple restaurants.
- Real-time updates of menu and orders via Firebase.
- User authentication and profile management using Firebase Auth.
